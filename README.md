# story-book

## Description

This project was built to display short stories written by my daughter, who wanted the world to read her tales. The site has a search based navbar, with different catagories to filter the stories displayed, a main section with a brief description of current and upcoming stories, and a "book" section which will display a default story and any filtered choices. The site also has a timer to support and encourage longer periods of reading.
